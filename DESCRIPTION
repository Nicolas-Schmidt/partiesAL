Description: This package provides two related datasets. 
    The first one, called `parties`, is a dataset where the unit of 
    analysis is the political party in each year in the congress for 
    21 countries of the Americas (20 Latin American countries plus 
    the United States) in the period from 1925 to 2019. The second 
    dataset (`parties2`) is an aggregation of this data, compiled 
    into a unit that becomes country-year. This second database 
    provides an additional set of systemic variables such as the 
    effective number of parties in each chamber of the congress.
